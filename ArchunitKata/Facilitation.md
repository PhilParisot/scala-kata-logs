# Test your Architecture with ArchUnit

## Learning Goals

- Understand the advantages of using a library like `ArchUnit`
- Clarify how we can use it on a daily basis

## Connect - Architecture?
In group, discuss what are your current `architecture rules` inside your team and how you ensure that your code is always matching those rules

Examples :
 
- All our events must reside in the events package
- Our repository layer can only be accessed through our application layer
- â€¦

## Concepts - What is it?
You can use the slides available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/thirion/test-your-architecture-with-archunit) for this part

## Concrete Practice - Create some rules

### Solution

Solution is available in the `solution` folder

## Conclusion - Reflect

- What can we do with it ?
- Which rules could be useful ?
- Any volunteers to go further ?
